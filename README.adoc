This project provides pre-built versions of OS images with all you need to develop 100% pure Java applications for specific Raspberry Pi setups. They are based on the latest official https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/[Raspberry Pi OS] and are automatically built using Packer.

== What's in the box?

By using these images, you will get a lot of preconfigurations (locale, keyboard, wireless,...), pre-installations (Java, JavaFX, starter scripts), and a very useful desktop background showing the Ethernet and/or WLAN address and hostname.

For a full list see: https://pi4j.com/pi4j-os/[pi4j.com/pi4j-os].

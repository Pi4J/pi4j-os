This project provides pre-built versions of OS images with all you need to develop 100% pure Java applications for specific Raspberry Pi setups. They are based on the latest official https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/[Raspberry Pi OS] and are automatically built using Packer. By using these images, you will get:

* preconfigured locale (en_US), keyboard (US) and timezone (Europe/Zurich)
* preconfigured wireless country (Switzerland) by default
* remote management via `SSH` and `VNC` enabled by default
* preinstalled https://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK 17] with latest https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/[JavaFX 20]
* starter script to launch JavaFX-apps in DRM (aka kiosk-mode)
* preconfigured `/boot/config.txt` supporting all components out of the box
* dynamic wallpaper showing Ethernet/WLAN address and hostname
* user account `pi`, password `pi4j`
** you have to set the corresponding preferences in Raspberry Pi Imager
* default WLAN connection
** setup a hotspot, for example on your smartphone, and you are ready to go.
*** ssid: `Pi4J-Spot`
*** password: `MayTheSourceBeWithYou!`
** your laptop has to be in the same WLAN as the RaspPi


The zip-compressed archives of released versions can be downloaded from https://pi4j-download.com[pi4j-download.com].

* for the snapshot releases have a look at the https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-os/actions[Actions tab.]

* Extract it and flash it using https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/[Raspberry Pi Imager]
** Use its 'Advanced Options' to create a new user `pi`, password `pi4j`

== Test the Pi4J OS-Images

The images contain two simple applications in directory `java-examples` and a sample file to test the audio channel. Start them via `ssh`.

=== Audio Test

[source, shell]
cd /home/pi
nvlc Music/StarTrekTheme.mp3


=== Pure JavaFX Application

Compile the JavaFX application

[source, shell]
cd /home/pi/java-examples/pure-javafx
javac --module-path /opt/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.media hellofx/HelloFX.java

To start `HelloFX` in X11-Mode
[source, shell]
DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/pi/.Xauthority sudo -E java --module-path /opt/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media -Dglass.platform=gtk hellofx.HelloFX

To start `HelloFX` in DRM (Direct Rendering Mode)
[source, shell]
sudo java-kiosk hellofx.HelloFX

`java-kiosk` is a command provided by our image. It assures to call `java` with the correct (and huge) set of parameters.



=== Pure Pi4J Application

Attach a button to `pin 25`. 

- on CrowPi that's the `left`-button. 
- on Picade Console that's the `button-4`-button. 
- Otherwise:

image::assets/pi4j-minimal.png[Button on Pin 25]

Compile and start the Java application
[source, shell]
cd /home/pi/java-examples/pure-pi4j
javac -cp "/home/pi/deploy/*:." hellopi4j/MinimalPi4J.java
sudo java -cp "/home/pi/deploy/*:." hellopi4j.MinimalPi4J


== Additional Test for Pi4J-Picade-OS Image

The audio test should use the internal loudspeaker.


Compile the JavaFX application

[source, shell]
cd /home/pi/java-examples/pure-picade
javac --module-path /opt/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.media hellopicade/HelloPicade.java


To start `HelloPicade` in X11-Mode
[source, shell]
DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/pi/.Xauthority sudo -E java --module-path /opt/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media -Dglass.platform=gtk hellopicade.HelloPicade


To start `HelloPicade` in DRM

[source, shell]
sudo java-kiosk hellopicade.HelloPicade


Check the mapping of the Picade buttons to JavaFX KeyCodes:

|===
|Picade |KeyCode

|Joystick up
|KeyCode.UP

|Joystick down
|KeyCode.DOWN

|Joystick left
|KeyCode.LEFT

|Joystick right
|KeyCode.RIGHT

|right side black button
|KeyCode.ENTER

|left side black button
|KeyCode.ESCAPE

|all other buttons
|no mapping
